         <p>Psychological testing sounds intimidating, especially if it has been suggested for you or your child</p>
         <p>or other family member. Sure, you know that everyone has flaws and personality quirks, but accepting that</p>
         <p>someone wants to take a close look at your internal makeup, at how you think about and handle things</p>
         <p>that can be too close for comfort. On the other hand, perhaps youâ€™ve wondered if this type of testing could</p>
         <p>put a finger on how you learn, or why you or people you love struggle.</p>
         <p>What if it could help you as a parent, to help you understand why your children react the way they do, and how you could better</p>
         <p>with it?</p>
